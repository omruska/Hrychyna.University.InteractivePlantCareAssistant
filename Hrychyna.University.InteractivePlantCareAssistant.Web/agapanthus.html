            <p class="section-title">Where to Place</p>
            <p class="section-content">Agapanthus is cold-hardy in USDA zones 8-11, and some varieties are hardy in zone 7. Choose a location that receives full sun unless the climate is very hot; in that case, some shade is beneficial. The soil needs to be moist, rich and well-draining. They do well in garden beds and borders or in containers. Agapanthus can handle salty winds, which makes them a particularly good choice for coastal gardens.</p>

            <p class="section-title">Planting Tips</p>
            <p class="section-content">How and When to Plant Agapanthus</p>
            <p>Plant bare-root agapanthus in the late fall in warm climates or in the spring after the last frost in cool climates. In the garden, plant the rhizomes 12 to 24 inches deep in moist, well-draining soil. The root crown should be facing up and positioned at soil level.</p>
            <p>If you have a nursery plant, dig a hole in the garden as deep as the nursery container and twice as wide. Loosen the soil in the bottom of the hole. Wear gloves to remove the plant from its container and gently loosen the roots with your hands. Set it in the ground at the same level as in the container. Backfill the hole and press down to remove air pockets. Water the plant. Spacing guidelines for multiple plants will depend on the variety you've selected. Consult the tag that came with your plants to ensure proper placement.</p>
            <p>Agapanthus can also be grown in containers filled with potting soil.</p>

            <p class="section-content">Agapanthus Care Tips</p>
            <p>Light</p>
                <p>Agapanthus plants grow best in full sun and need six to eight hours of sun a day for the best bloom production. However, in extremely hot climates, they benefit from partial shade.</p>
                
            <p>Soil and Water</p>
                <p>Choose a location with rich soil that drains well. Agapanthus plants appreciate regular watering and don't like to dry out for long. Be consistent with watering to prevent stress from hindering future blooms, especially just after the plant completes a bloom cycle.</p>
                
            <p>Temperature and Humidity</p>
                <p>Many agapanthus species are evergreen in tropical climates. The non-evergreen types require a little more protection and warmth during the cool season. As fall arrives, initiate their dormancy by withholding some water. Move the more tender evergreen varieties into a frost-free environment, like a greenhouse or near a bright window in a home. Hardier plants can be left out and sparsely watered until spring. Agapanthus can handle high humidity but does not require it.</p>
                
            <p>Fertilizer</p>
                <p>Since agapanthus plants are frequent bloomers, it's a good idea to fertilize them twice a year—in early spring and again two months later. Give them a balanced granular fertilizer such as 10-10-10 or one slightly higher in phosphorus than nitrogen to keep the blooms going all season long. for the amount to use, follow product label directions. Be sure to water it in well.</p>
                
            <p>Pruning</p>
                <p>Remove damaged leaves any time of year, but leave all the others on the plant so it can store the energy it needs for the following year. For agapanthus grown in the ground, cut back the foliage to about 4 inches in late fall when blooming is over. The plant will go dormant for the winter. Mulch the crown of the plant to protect it.</p>
                
            <p>During the blooming season, remove faded blossoms from the stem to encourage new growth and prevent the plant from wasting energy on seed production.</p>
                
            <p>Potting and Repotting Agapanthus</p>
                <p>A good tip for proper care of potted agapanthus is to divide the plants on a regular basis. In general, agapanthus plants don't mind being snugly planted in a pot. However, they appreciate being divided every few years to encourage new growth and increase blooms.</p>

            <p class="section-title">Pests and Problems</p>
            <p class="section-content">Spider mites, mealybugs, and thrips are attracted to agapanthus plants. Wash them off with a strong spray of water or treat them with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>

            <p>Root rot can become a problem if the plant sits in soggy soil. It can be prevented by planting in well-draining soil, but it can't be treated. Remove the affected plant from the garden and dispose of it.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="propagation" class="box">
            <p class="section-title">Propagation</p>
            <p>Agapanthus grows and spreads by fleshy rhizomes that act as storage roots. The plant retains nutrients in its roots and may be divided to create more plants. Use a sharp shovel to dig up an established plant and divide it into several sections, each with roots and foliage. Plant the sections back in the garden in well-draining soil or in containers of potting soil to give away.</p>
            <p>If you don't have a mature agapanthus plant, you can plant seeds, but it takes two or three years for the resulting plants to bloom. Buy seeds or harvest seed pods from an existing plant, keeping in mind that if the plant is a hybrid, the plants from harvested seeds won't be a match to the parent plant. Put harvested seed pods in a paper bag in a warm location and leave them until the pods open. In spring, plant them in a pot or flat with drainage holes. Use a rich planting mix with added perlite for drainage. Sprinkle the seeds on the planting mix and cover them with only 1/4 inch of the soil. Water the container and put it in a warm, sunny location. Germination takes about a month.</p>
